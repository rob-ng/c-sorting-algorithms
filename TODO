1. Implement Galloping mode for merging.

An attempt at galloping mode has been made for merge_runs_lo.
There are still (of course) issues:

- What to do during galloping mode if one or other or both or l and r are out
  of bounds?
  A: Don't enter galloping mode. This should be a condition for using
  galloping.
- How to increment l and r after successful gallop?
  A: Should increment by corresponding slice BETWEEN OPERATIONS.
- How to increment k?
  A: k should be incremented after each slice is found by slice.
- What to do if binary_search grows outside bounds of run?
  A: set srch_lo and srch_hi to hi bound.
- How should program react if after first gallop operation, one of the bounds
  has grown too large?

Galloping for merge_runs_lo ALMOST works, but you'll notice certain things
aren't sorted correctly.
