Timsort is nearly up to snuff. Their are only two things which warrant being
addressed in the future:
- Why is insertion sort faster than binary insertion sort during the run
  finding phase?
- Can bin_search_loc() function be improved using second binary search to find
  first / last duplicate rather than linear search?
